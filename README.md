## Additional Features
For Project 1, my additional features I have added is having a card view for the event page so it has a nice display to watch the trailer for the movie and get directions to the event meetup location.
Progress & Challenges
-	The status of Project 1 at this point is complete. I have no remaining portions to complete for this assignment, so consider this submission as complete and valid. I had very few issues with Bootstrap but I managed to fix them when I realized I used Bootstrap 4 instead of Bootstrap 5.
-	The easy parts of the assignment was creating the pages with the basic HTML content, but the most difficult part was doing the styling using bootstrap and getting it to the necessary stage it is at currently, but it was done with perseverance and I am glad I am finished with the project.
